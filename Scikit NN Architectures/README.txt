HW9 Extra Credit

This is my submission for homework 9 extra credit. 

Note that the relevant code is in a Classifier.ipynb file.
1) To run code that fully implements classification on the iris data set for all parameters (the first part of this assignment) run the first cell.
2) To run code that explores different non-linearities, run the second and third cells.
3) To run code that explores different algorithms for adjusting learning rate, run the remaining cell.

Note, in some cells I use functions defined in previous cells, so please run all cells in order while attempting to run this code. For instance, in one place I use a function defined in part 1 within cell 3 - which itself is for part 2.

Cell 1: Full implementation (script style) for classification on the iris data set
Cell 2: Class definitions to explore non linearities
Cell 3: Script like work for visualization and calculation needed to explore different non-linearities.
Cell 4: Script style work for exploring learning rate adjustment algorithms.
